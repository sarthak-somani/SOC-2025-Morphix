# Morphix: Sculpting Faces in Real-Time with Latent Spaces

### WnCC Seasons of Code 2025

---

## Project Overview

Morphix is an interactive web application that allows you to explore the creative potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Built with Python, Streamlit, and PyTorch, this tool leverages the power of a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model to generate and manipulate hyper-realistic human faces in real-time.

## Features

1. **Random Face Generation:** To generate new and random faces using GANs, use the 'new face' button.
2. **Feature Editing:** Use the sliders to make the faces look older, younger, happier or even try playing with their gender.
3. **Preset Transformations**: Click on the eyeglass button to see glasses appear magically on your generate face.
4. **Style Mixing**: Always wanted to blend two faces? We got you covered, have a look at the stlye mixing feature in the sidebar and have fun playing around.
5. **Experiment Fearlessly**: Undo/Redo capabilities ensure that you can always go back if an edit was not to your liking.
6. **Instant Results**: Watch in awe as your generated faces load almost instantly.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sarthak-somani/SOC-2025-Morphix.git
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies separate.

    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python packages using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    Now, launch the Streamlit app.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    After running the command, your terminal will provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser to start using Morphix!
